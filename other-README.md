# Adrian Liu
I'm a PhD student in philosophy at Rutgers â€“ New Brunswick, advised by Ted Sider. I work in metaphysics and formal epistemology, and have interests in Classical Chinese philosophy.

Before Rutgers, I studied math and philosophy at Stanford and worked in the state court system in California. I'm originally from San Diego.
